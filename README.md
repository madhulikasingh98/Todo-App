System Design
The application consists of the following main components:

TaskForm: Handles the creation of new tasks.
TaskList: Displays the list of tasks.
TaskItem: Represents an individual task item.
SearchBar: Provides search functionality to filter tasks.
Data Storage
The application uses a dummy JSON file (tasks.json) as a data repository. The tasks are loaded from this file on application startup.

Implementation Details
The tasks are stored in the state of the App component.
The TaskForm component is used to create new tasks.
The TaskList component renders a list of TaskItem components.
The TaskItem component displays individual tasks and allows for marking them as done and expanding to show details.
The SearchBar component filters tasks based on the search term.
CSS Styling
The application uses a CSS file (App.css) for basic styling. The styles are applied to various elements to enhance the visual appearance.

Future Enhancements
Implement Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for enhanced performance (if using Next.js).
Utilize URL parameters to manage search queries and filters.
Ensure the application is easily adaptable for future enhancements.
